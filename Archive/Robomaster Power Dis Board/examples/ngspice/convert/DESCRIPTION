<b>Simulation example: convert</b>
<p>
This example is meant to show how to convert from a schematic that is
not yet simulation-capable to one that is.  Open convert.sch and select
all parts, then choose Add Model from the context menu.  Converted.sch is
the result after mapping all parts, and is simulation-ready.
