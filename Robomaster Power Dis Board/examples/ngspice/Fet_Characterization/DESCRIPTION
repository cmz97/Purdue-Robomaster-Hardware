<b>Simulation example: Fet_Characterization</b>
<p>
This example generates characteristic MOSFET curves, showing the
transistor turn on as the gate voltage is swept.  It can also be
used to view a sweep over the drain voltage with a fixed gate voltage.
DC Sweep type simulation is used in this example.
